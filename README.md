I create the basic layout of the webpage using html including a header containing my name and a
footer with my email address. I was able to add a photo of myself and I have it set to stay in the same position
on the screen when the user scrolls down the screen. I was able to match the color scheme of my resume by
using RGB values. I added two links one to a pdf of my resume and the other to my LinkedIn account. I was able
to make my website be able to be view on smaller devices. I formatted the text to where it resembled thy way
my resume was

Put the header and footer as well as the sidebar in separate php files and used the include() statement to include it in all webpages for the website. I created a separate webpage for any person to be able to contact me, but I donâ€™t have a server set up to be able to store the information, so I used a JavaScript to tell the user that the information has been sent. I got rid of the left side bar and chose to move to a two-column layout and make the right sidebar scroll along with the user as they travel down the page. I also added a background image to match that of my sprint plans. And I change the background color of my main content box to a transparent black, so you can still see the background and still be able to read the content.
